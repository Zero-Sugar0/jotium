## Architecture

### Jotium Agent Core ([`ai/jotium.ts`](./ai/jotium.ts))

-   **AIAgent Class:** The central orchestrator, wrapping Google Gemini, managing agent memory, and integrating the Enhanced Agentic Engine.
-   **Tool Integration:** Dynamically registers and exposes a wide array of tools to Gemini as function declarations.
-   **Memory Management:** Persists conversation history and tool results for contextual awareness.
-   **Streaming Responses:** Delivers real-time output, including agent thoughts and tool execution details, via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
-   **System Prompt:** Guides Jotium to operate as a human-like, proactive, and highly capable autonomous agent.

### Enhanced Agentic Engine ([`ai/actions.ts`](./ai/actions.ts))

-   **Core Intelligence:** Implements the multi-layered reasoning and adaptive execution logic.
-   **Intent Classification:** Analyzes user messages to classify intent, required tools, and autonomy level.
-   **Workflow Orchestration:** Dynamically generates and executes multi-step workflows, handling dependencies, fallbacks, and real-time adaptations.
-   **Contextual Parameter Enhancement:** Enriches tool parameters with dynamic context for more precise operations.

### Tool System ([`ai/tools/`](./ai/tools/))

Each tool adheres to a simple interface:
-   `getDefinition()`: Provides a function declaration for Gemini's tool calling.
-   `execute(args)`: Contains the specific logic for the tool's operation.

## Tool Example: Advanced Research

```js
// The agent autonomously orchestrates multiple search tools and synthesizes results
const researchResult = await agent.chat("Conduct a comprehensive market analysis report for the AI in healthcare sector, including recent trends and key players.");
console.log(researchResult.summary, researchResult.findings, researchResult.visualizations);
```

## Tool Example: Project Task Creation (ClickUp)

```js
// The agent intelligently creates tasks based on context
const taskResult = await agent.chat("Create a new task in ClickUp for 'Develop new user authentication module' with high priority, due next Friday, assigned to John Doe.");
console.log(taskResult.summary, taskResult.taskDetails);
```

## Adding a New Tool

1.  Create a new file in `ai/tools/` that implements the `Tool` interface:
    -   `getDefinition()`: Define the tool's capabilities and parameters for Gemini.
    -   `execute(args)`: Implement the core logic of your tool.
2.  Register your new tool in `ai/jotium.ts` within the `initializeTools()` method.
3.  (Optional) Add any required environment variables for API keys/secrets to your `.env.local` file.

---

## Security Best Practices

-   **Environment Variables:** Always load API keys and sensitive tokens from environment variables (`.env.local`). **Never commit `.env` files** to your repository.
-   **Input Validation:** All sensitive operations (file system, code execution, API calls) are protected by robust authentication and input validation mechanisms.
-   **Least Privilege:** Tools are designed to operate with the minimum necessary permissions.
